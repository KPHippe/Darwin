This is a simple 'game' in which creatures roam around a 
40 x 40 board. Each creature has a script of moves they follow.

Blue Creature - Hop
    This just hops forward blindly,
    it's good for testing that your program works at all.

Green Creature - Food
    Food just sits there and spins but doesn't infect anyone.

Red Creature - Flytrap
    The flytrap sits in one place and spins.
    It infects anything which comes in front.
    Flytraps do well when they clump.

Black Creature - Rover
    The rover constantly moves forward.  When it
    runs into a wall or another rover, it randomly
    turns left or right.
